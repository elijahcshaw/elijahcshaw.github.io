<!-- I'm going to leave this comment here and not spread out in the code because this is really simple HTML, but I basically just added every required 
    tag from the assignment and tried to make them at least somewhat decent looking on the page. I stayed away from doing any major CSS yet since I want 
    to focus on that in the upcoming week, but there's some inline styles provided to make the page a little prettier-->

        <h3>Sample Text</h3>
            <p>This is a sample <strong>paragraph</strong>. A <strong>paragraph</strong> is made up of sentences. The HTML tag doesn't have that requirement. <em>This</em> sentence in particular contains a <span style="color:royalblue">styled span of text.</span></p>
